### Branching Model

BrewPro uses a branching model based on [nvie](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) post.

TL;DR;

You should name your branch based off of the ticket JIRA you are working on. If the JIRA ticket is
`BP 36 Some Feature` then your branch should be name something like `BP-36-some-feature`. You should
branch off of develop. Once the feature is complete you should then create a PR with the `develop`
branch as its desitnation. It will then be reviewed.
